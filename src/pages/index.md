A frontend web developer, ui engineer, drummer, and wannabe pilot living in the south east of England.

I try my best to build web solutions that are [resilient](https://resilientwebdesign.com/), [usable](https://trentwalton.com/2014/03/10/device-agnostic/) and as future-friendly as possible. For this reason I prefer a vanilla approach and tend to be fairly tech-agnostic.

## What's this website about?

This could turn out to be a version of my main site ([brootaylor.com](https://brootaylor.com)) using the Astro web framework.

More than likely this will serve up specific content that I'd like to render on a subdomain of my main site, such as a portfolio or CV/resume.

I guess we'll see...
