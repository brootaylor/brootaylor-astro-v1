A frontend web developer, ui engineer, drummer, and wannabe pilot living in the south east of England.

I try my best to build web solutions that are [resilient](https://resilientwebdesign.com/), [usable](https://trentwalton.com/2014/03/10/device-agnostic/) and as future-friendly as possible. For this reason I prefer a vanilla approach and tend to be fairly tech-agnostic.
